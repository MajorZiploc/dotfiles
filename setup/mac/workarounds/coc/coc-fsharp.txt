On arm mac m1 systems, you will need to add this content to:
file: ~/.config/coc/extensions/node_modules/coc-fsharp/out/client/fsac.js

// The "osx-arm64" key,value pair needs to be added

const fsac_pkgs = {
    "win-x64": {
        executable: "fsautocomplete.dll",
        platformPath: "fsautocomplete.netcore.zip"
    },
    "linux-x64": {
        executable: "fsautocomplete.dll",
        platformPath: "fsautocomplete.netcore.zip"
    },
    "osx-x64": {
        executable: "fsautocomplete.dll",
        platformPath: "fsautocomplete.netcore.zip"
    },
    "osx-arm64": {
        executable: "fsautocomplete.dll",
        platformPath: "fsautocomplete.netcore.zip"
    },
    "linux-arm64": {
        executable: "fsautocomplete.dll",
        platformPath: "fsautocomplete.netcore.zip"
    },
};

Once you do this, your intellisense for fsharp should work in vim
